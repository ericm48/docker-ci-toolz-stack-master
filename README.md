# Welcome to the docker-ci-toolz-stack-master repo!

This repo contains artifacts for Orchestraton and a CI System (Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, and Selenium Grid) inside
Docker Containers.   

To give credit where credit is due, this Docker CI Setup was initially built off of:  
[Continouous Integration Platform] (https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/continuous-integration-platform-using-docker-container-jenkins-sonarqube-nexus-gitlab/ "Continouous Integration Platform")

## Notes:
-All containers where modified to leverage docker volumes to make data externally available.

-Yes, I have the .deb files located under ./installers.  This is to:
  1. Ensure the proper version is installed 
  2. Mitigate dep repos that go MIA until I get an Object-Storage solution.  My choice...

## Jenkins
The Jenkins Image is setup primary for Ansible Development, which includes the Ansible install as well as Postfix (for email notifications).

## Nexus
The nexus docker-volume WILL NOT work on a MAC. (At least with what I've tried...if you gotta an idea, I'm all for it!)
To get the nexus container to work with the docker volume, you must execute the following commands BEFORE you do the initial build on the Nexus Image.

userdel nexus
useradd -u 300 --user-group --system nexus
mkdir -p /mnt/dockervolumes/data/nexus && chown -R 300 /mnt/dockervolumes/data/nexus
